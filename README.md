# IDS-P1

One kind of security system is an intrusion detection system (IDS), which keeps an eye on network traffic and notifies system administrators or security staff of any unauthorised or questionable behaviour. An open-source collection of computer vision tools and techniques called OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) can be used for object detection, picture processing, and tracking.

Video surveillance: Unauthorised entry into a restricted location or questionable behaviour in a public place are examples of physical space incursions that can be found using OpenCV's video analysis capabilities.
